This is for separating the cumulative report of how students did on an assignment to just a report on your students.

Steps

1. You have to download the student report on an assignment using the “Download” button after selecting “Comma separated values text file”.

2. You have to put in your students’ names in the separateClass.py file, as shown inside.

3. In terminal/command prompt, put in “python separateClass.py <input file> <output file>, for example I would put “python separateClass.py ch4ex1.csv output.csv”

4. Now you should have a csv file containing only your students’ data.
